# 2023/03/20 Slight Mods by JGM to use dealerv2, bash, seeds in the Descr.* files 
#
# Makefile to process all Descr.* files with dealer and write the output
# to Output.*.  make test executes the test, make clean cleans up.
# Edit the line DEALER to call upon the test version or the production version.
#

DEALER = ../dealerv2
#DEALER = dealerv2
