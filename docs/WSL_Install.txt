# ---- JGM has received the following note from a user: ---------------------
I have successfully executed dealerv2 at my windows pc following this process

1: Open a command prompt in administrator mode
2: Execute wsl --install
3: Restart computer - after restart windows will install Linux
4: Enter name and password of your own choice and close that window
5: Open a command prompt and switch to the directory where you want your input files
6: Type bash and enter and you will now start Linux
7: Enter sudo git clone https://github.com/dealerv2/Dealer-Version-2-.git (You will have to enter your password)
8 Execute command:
    sudo apt-get install libgomp1

9: switch to the downloaded repository

cd Dealer-Version-2-/Prod

10: type
./dealerv2

Now enter the input to dealer and end it with a blank line and press Ctrl D

Now you should get the output from dealer

Step 8 is needed but following these instructions you won't need to build the application, and thus won't need the different developer tools

Best regards
