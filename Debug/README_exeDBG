This Debug directory contains the Makefile and the executable for the debug version of dealerv2.
Extra code has been included in this executable to report on the state of the program at various points.
All of the debug output is sent to stderr, so that you can send it to a separate file for later viewing 
rather than see it mixed with the actual output on the screen.
To get the debug output put -Dn on the command line where n is a number from 0 to 9.
Zero suppresses debug output, 9 gives very verbose debug output.

Other files in this directory are likely artifacts and can be ignored.
