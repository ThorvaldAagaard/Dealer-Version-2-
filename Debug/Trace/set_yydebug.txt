   /* if you want tracing done, you need to set yydebug to 1; to do that you need yydebug defined.
    * to do that you need to either define it yourself, or include dealyacc.tab.h -- a real mess
    */
  #ifdef JGMDBG
    #include "dealyacc.tab.h"
    #ifdef YYDEBUG
      extern int yydebug ;
    #else
      static int yydebug ;
   #endif
  #endif
#endif

and in main you need to have
    yydebug = 1 ;
or some other way of setting it to 1. and defining it so it does not conflict ...
