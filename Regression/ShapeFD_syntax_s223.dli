title " Stress Test Francois Dellacherie Shapes "
  // This file shows examples of Using the Various Francois Dellachrie shape operators in a simple way.
  // That is not combinining too many into one statement
  // The file generates 407 individual distributions from the 10 'shape{}' statements. +1 traditional shape() statement

  // in the Sample shapes produced explanation not all are shown as there are usually WAY too many

condition   shape(north, any 4441 - 1444 )    // allowed to put legacy shape command in same file as FD shape cmd
     or     shape{north, 5x5x + x5x5 + 6xxx + x6xx } // allowed to put simple legacy distributions in FD shape cmd

          // At least (+) and at most (-) operators
