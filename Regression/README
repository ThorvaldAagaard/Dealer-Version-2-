This is the directory Regression 

The Dealer Input files (suffix .dli) in this directory all have a seed cmd in them; 
the seed number is typically a prime.
The primes can be got from the ./Code/files_mod.pl
The Makefile will run scripts in the Code sub-directory to:
a) create files with suffix .out in the Output sub-directory by running dealerv2 on the .dli file
b) create files with suffix .ref in the Refer  sub-directory by running production version of dealerv2 on the .dli file
c) check the .out files vs the .ref files for differences.
